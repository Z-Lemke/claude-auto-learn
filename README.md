# auto-claude-builder

A Claude plugin that automatically improves repository-level `.claude` configuration based on learned experiences.

## Concept

When an agent encounters a problem and learns how to solve it (through developer guidance), this plugin automatically updates the local `.claude` folder to provide the necessary context to solve similar problems correctly in the future.

## Status

In development - specifications and implementation details coming soon.
