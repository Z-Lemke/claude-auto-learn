# /progress — View Learning Progress

You have been asked to show learning progress.

## Instructions

1. **Activate the progress skill** to display the learner's dashboard.

2. Follow the progress skill's workflow:
   - Load all course and progress data
   - Display overall progress, unit breakdown, strengths, weaknesses
   - Show items due for review
   - Give a concrete recommendation for what to do next

3. If no courses exist, tell the learner to run `/build-course` first.

## Important

- This is read-only — do not modify any state.
- Keep the display concise and scannable.
- Always end with a recommended next action.
